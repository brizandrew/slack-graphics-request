# Graphics Request Slack App

This repo is for a session facilitated by me at SRCCON 2018 that goes by the same name. The project was meant to create a Slack app using as many as Slack's API functionalities as possible in order to showcase the full potential of using Slack as a front-end for newsroom tools.
